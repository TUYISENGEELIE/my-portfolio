            <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
            <p>
                The Data Scientist is responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing massive amounts of race data
                in real time.
                They design predictive models that help forecast driver performance, tire wear, and fuel consumption
                using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
                Through this role, we demonstrate the power of data science in solving real-world challenges,
                encouraging young developers to embrace
                data-driven problem-solving and machine learning innovation.
